# fauxcompiler
An XML based Development Tool written in Python 

This is currently a rough prototype which aims to illustrate the types of developement tools I wish to build. 
This particular tool parses an xml file which loads data to create a mysql script. 

Future versions may use some form of the Observer Pattern in order to write the various data in multiple ways. 
For example, creating Java Bean Objects, DAO Objects as well as the SQL code. 

Stay Tuned for more!
